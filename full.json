    "explanation": "This question refers to Chapter 4, page 111 (Section 4.1.2. Share Capital for Management Companies) for context regarding how entities supervised by CySEC are capitalized. While Chapter 9 focuses on CIFs under CRR/CRD, the principle of relating own funds to overheads is a common prudential measure.
